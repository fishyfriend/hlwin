hlwin.el provides a global minor mode to highlight the active window.

DEPRECATION NOTICE

This package was never released or promoted actively.  Just before I wrapped up
work on it, auto-dim-other-buffers released a change that appears to provide a
better solution, at least for users of Emacs 27. Specifically, rather than
using overlays as this package does, it uses face remapping in conjunction with
Emacs 27's :filtered face attribute.  This should avoid some of the visual
glitches and clashes with other packages that were hard to avoid while using
overlays.

This code will not be maintained, but may be useful for anyone who wants to
highlight the active window in Emacs 26 or below.

ALTERNATIVES

As mentioned, users of Emacs 27 should probably use auto-dim-other-buffers
instead of this package. It is available on MELPA and GitHub.

Additionally, I rediscovered another similarly-named package, hiwin, that does
something similar to hlwin, also using overlays. (Apparently the name stuck in
my head.) Based on the issues and PRs, hiwin looks to be unmaintained.
